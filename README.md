This repository contains all of my code, projects, labs, and worklogs from the Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Data Science and Machine Learning class for the 2023â€“2024 academic year.

Over the course of the year, I explored the fields of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML). The class focused on understanding and applying machine learning models and concepts to real-world problems through a mix of theory and hands-on projects.
